# Customer Complaints Analysis
## Overview
This project involved analyzing thousands of consumer complaints submitted to an organization using Excel to uncover key patterns in complaint volume, product issues, and company responses. I transformed raw complaint records into a clean, interactive dashboard that highlights trends, resolution efficiency, and customer behaviour in a single visual report.
## Background
In today’s financial ecosystem, customer experience plays a pivotal role in shaping how financial institutions interact with consumers. One key indicator of this relationship is the frequency and nature of complaints lodged by consumers against banks, lenders, credit reporting agencies, and other financial service providers.

The Organization collects and publishes complaints submitted by consumers across the United States. These complaints cover a wide range of products and services  from mortgages and credit cards to student loans and credit reporting, and are submitted through various channels like phone, email, and web portals. Each record provides valuable information on the product involved, the issue reported, the company's public and private responses, and whether the issue was resolved on time.

This project aimed to analyze these complaints to uncover hidden patterns, track performance in consumer handling, and better understand what types of products and issues generate the most dissatisfaction. By creating an interactive dashboard in Excel, I aimed to bring clarity to the trends and insights buried in the data, while also developing my skills in Excel analytics, data cleaning, and visualization.
This analysis is especially important in a business or regulatory context, where companies and stakeholders can use such insights to improve customer service, reduce complaint volumes, and ensure compliance with fair treatment policies.
## TOOLS I USED
Microsoft Excel: For Data visualization, formulas, pivot tables, and charts.

Power Query: Used for Data cleaning and transformation

Slicers: For Dynamic Filtering.
## ANALYSIS
This dashboard offers a clear and interactive view of consumer complaint patterns across different financial products and services. It was designed to help users quickly identify which products receive the most complaints, what the common issues are, and how companies typically respond.
### Seasonal complaints trends
 I identified patterns in complaint volume over time. Notably, complaints peaked in March and July, with March accounting for 11.6% of all submissions. These seasonal spikes may align with  financial deadlines that prompt consumers to engage with financial institutions.
### Complaint Resolution Patterns
The most common resolution was “Closed with Explanation,” accounting for over 70% of complaints. In contrast, monetary relief was provided in less than 5% of cases. This suggests that most companies aim to resolve issues through clarification rather than financial compensation, a finding that reflects the operational tendencies of customer service departments in finance.
### Response Timeliness Assessment
A timely response is crucial in customer care. My analysis showed that about 87% of complaints were responded to within the expected timeframe. However, untimely responses were notably more frequent in the Loans and Debt Collection categories. This may point to backlog issues, internal approval delays, or process inefficiencies for certain financial products.
### Complaint Submission Channel
I also analyzed how consumers submitted their complaints, whether through the Web, Phone, or web referrals. This behavioural insight showed that phone submission was by far the most popular method, suggesting the growing digital preference for resolving financial issues. This was visualized using a doughnut chart for intuitive comparison.
